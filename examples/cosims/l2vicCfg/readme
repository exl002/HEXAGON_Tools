Beginning with HexagonV4, multiple SIRC's has been replaced with a single
Level-2 Vector Interrupt Controller (L2VIC).

The L2VIC contains up to 32 "slices" of 32 interrupts each, creating a pool
of up to 1024 interrupt numbers (0 to 1023).

In order to use the L2VIC cosim, a cosim configuration file must be created
which specifies L2VIC parameters for the platform for which the simulation
is to be peformed.

Here is an example of a cosim config file that specifies an L2VIC:

  Windows:
  --------
    l2vic.dll 4 0x7b010000

  Linux:
  ------
    l2vic.so 4 0x7b010000

  Note that an optional explicit path may be added to the front of the shared
  object.



L2VIC Cosim Syntax:
-------------------
  Linux:   [path/]l2vic.so  <slices> <l2vic_base_addr>
  Windows: [path\]l2vic.dll <slices> <l2vic_base_addr>

Required Parameters:
  <slices>          - Specifies the number of 'slices' supported by the L2VIC
                      cosim.
  <l2vic_base_addr> - Specifies the base address of the L2VIC registers.



Usage:
------
>hexagon-sim --cosim_file l2vic.cfg <app.elf>
