/*! 
Performs (scaled) N-point complex FFT  

\param Input pointer to input buffer
\param points number of FFT points
\param twiddles pointer to twiddles factor array
\param Output pointer to output buffer

\details

\b Assembly \b Assumptions
 - \a Input must be aligned by array size
 - \a Output must be aligned by 8-bytes
 - \a twiddles must be aligned by 4-bytes

\b Cycle-Count
 - (7N/8+5)*K - (N+32)/24   + 10, for N = 4^K
 - (7N/8+5)*K + (17N-16)/24 + 13, for N= 2*(4^K) 

\b Notes
 - Radix-4 DIF implementation
 - 3N/4 twiddle factors are interleaved and stored in bit-reverse order.
 - TWOS_COMPLEMENT_ROUNDING defines convergent/2's-complement rounding mode.
