/// @brief Execute a Scop conditionally.
///
/// In the CFG the optimized code of the Scop is generated next to the
/// original code. Both the new and the original version of the code remain
/// in the CFG. A branch statement decides which version is executed.
/// For now, we always execute the new version (the old one is dead code
/// eliminated by the cleanup passes). In the future we may decide to execute
/// the new version only if certain run time checks succeed. This will be
/// useful to support constructs for which we cannot prove all assumptions at
/// compile time.
///
/// Before transformation:
///
///                        bb0
///                         |
///                     orig_scop
///                         |
///                        bb1
///
/// After transformation:
///                        bb0
///                         |
