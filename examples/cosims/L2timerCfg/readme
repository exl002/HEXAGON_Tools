The timers (both RTOS and User timers) have been removed from the simulator 
library and are now implemented as a cosim model.  

In order to properly simulate RTOS applications, a cosim configuration 
file must be created which specifies two instances of the timer cosim, 
parameterized for the platform for which the simulation is to be performed.  
An example timer cosim configuration file for the Raptor platform is 
provided.  

Specification of a timer cosim within a cosim config file is as follows:

$(path_to_L2VIC_cosim}/l2vic.so 3 0xab010000
$(path_to_L2timer_cosim}/L2timer.so 32768 0xab000000 67 0xab010000

 Argument 1 - frequency in Hz.
 Argument 2 - base address of the timer configuration registers 
 Argument 3 - interrupt pin number to the L2VIC
 Argument 4 - base address of the L2VIC configuration registers

Usage:
>qdsp6-sim --cosim_file timer.cfg app.elf

This timer cosim is intended to be used in conjunction with the L2VIC
cosim (level 2 vectored interrupt controller).  The interrupt pin number
indicates which interrupt within which L2VIC slice is to be asserted
when the timer fires.  Each L2VIC "slice" has 32 interrupts, each numbered
from 0 to 31.  To specify interrupt 3 on slice 2 you should use
(2 * 32) + 3 = 67 as the 3rd argument for this cosim.
