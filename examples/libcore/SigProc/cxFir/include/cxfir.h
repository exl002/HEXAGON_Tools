/*! 
Peforms FIR filtering on block of complex data

\param xin pointer to input buffer
\param coefs pointer to coefficents array
\param taps number of taps of FIR filter
\param length number of data to be filtered
\param Qshift shift factor after accumulation
\param yout pointer to output buffer

\details

\b Assembly \b Assumptions
 - \a taps and \a length are multiples of 2 and no less than 4 and 2 respectively
 - \a xin and \a yout arrays are aligned by 8-bytes
 - \a coefs arrays are aligned by 4-bytes
 - coefficients must be arranged in reverse order.

\b Cycle-Count
 - length/2 * (taps + 3) + 4

\b Notes
 - multi-sample implementation to reduce load bandwidth.
 - 32-bit accumulator used for summation of real/image part.
