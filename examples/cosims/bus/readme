Bus interface cosimulation module
-------------------

Bus interface cosim module 

This cosim module models latency incurred by a bus access. 
The access latency can be configured via the DELAY flag
in bus.h, which indicates the number of cycles the bus transaction
will be delayed. The depth of the bus queue can be changed via the
MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH flag in bus.h. Note that changing the values of these
flags in the header file requires a clean make in order for the 
changes to take effect.
	
This is a simple implementation that registers itself for a bus 
access callback across the entire memory map. When a bus access 
occurs, debug accesses are serviced immediately. For non-debug 
accesses, a BusRequest container is set up to store the details of 
the transaction, and a timed callback is registered with a pointer 
to the newly created BusRequest container. The interval of the timed 
callback is derived from the value of the DELAY flag. The callback 
function uses the pointer to the BusRequest container passed back to 
it to service the request, and then deletes the container. 
	 

To build:

From the src directory, run the following commands in a shell:
> make clean
> make

This will build the cosim and launch a simulation with the 
cosim attached. The makefile will run a hello world app on
the simulator with the cosim attached. 

Windows:

Note that building on Windows requires MSVC 2005 and Cygwin. 
Prior to building the cosim, run vsvars32.bat from the following
directory to make sure all the proper MSVC variables are
set up:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools

Linux:

Building on Linux requires a version of GCC compatible with
4.1.2 to be installed in your system path. 

The path and name of the cosim is listed in a file which 
is passed to the simulator via the --cosim_file option:

${COSIM_PATH}/${COSIM_LIB}

Where:

${COSIM_LIB} = bus.so  on linux32/64
${COSIM_LIB} = bus.dll on cygwin

Refer to the Hexagon Simulator System API User Guide 
(80-VB419-20) for more details on creating cosimulation 
models. The most recent version of the User Guide can
