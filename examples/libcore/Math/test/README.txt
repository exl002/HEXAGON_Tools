This example tests the QDSP6 optimized DSP oriented routines 
(approximate divide, approximate invert, trigonomic functions, etc.)
found in "dsp_libs.h".  It runs against a sample set of 
data and compares the output against precomputed values.

To run:

make clean
make sim

The simulation will print "*** PASS" if the test passed.
