/* This last version shows how to complete the vectorization with
   dynamic peeling.  This solution uses 2 helper functions, however,
   and is encouraged for code readability.  The VecADD_misaligned
   function first calls a scalar version of vector add to implement
   the dynamic peeling.  Then, the remaining iterations are handled by
   calling a vectorized vector add function that implements cleanup.
   This solution is preferred because it isolates the assumptions for
   each routine.  The scalar version makes no assumptions, while the
   vectorized version assumes that the data is aligned and the correct
   length.  Composing these functions allows the creation of a
   vectorized function that makes no assumptions about the input
   data. */
