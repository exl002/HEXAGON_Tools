The timers (both RTOS and User timers) have been removed from the simulator 
library and are now implemented as a cosim model.  

In order to properly simulate RTOS applications, a cosim configuration 
file must be created which specifies two instances of the timer cosim, 
parameterized for the platform for which the simulation is to be performed.  
An example timer cosim configuration file for the Raptor platform is 
provided.  

Specification of a timer cosim within a cosim config file is as follows:

$(path_to_timer_cosim}/timer.so 32000 0xab000000 2 

 Argument 1 - frequency in Hz.
 Argument 2 - base address of the timer configuration registers 
 Argument 3 - interrupt pin number to the DSP

Useage:
