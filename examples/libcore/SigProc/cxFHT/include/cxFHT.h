/*! 
Peforms fast Hadmard transform (FHT) on complex numbers.

\param in pointer to input buffer
\param N number of FHT points
\param out pointer to output buffer

\details

\b Assembly \b Assumptions
 - \a N is power of 2 and N>=4
 - \a input and \a output arrays are aligned by 8-bytes

\b Cycle-Count
 - (N+3)*K + 3*N/2 + 12, for N = 2*(4^k)
 - (N+3)*K +   N/2 + 9 , for N = 4^K

\b Notes
 - Radix-4 implementation.
 - Data types are different between input and output.
