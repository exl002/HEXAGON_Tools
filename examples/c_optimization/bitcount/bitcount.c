   body of the loop; instead, the counter is incremented
   unconditionally.  The increment, however, is 0 or 1, depending on
   the value of the current bit.  Thus, the semantics of the algorithm
   are preserved even though the control flow was eliminated.  Again,
   may appear to be a small and unrealistic example, but the main
   point is to show that sometimes an algorithm can be modified to
   eliminate unnecessary control flow. */
