crt0if example:
The crt0.s file provides C run time support for stand-alone and rtos applications. 
The mandelbrot.c application includes hexagon_standalone.h and demonstartes the use of API calls to crt0.s. 

Mechanism:
1. The application spawns worker threads using the "thread_create" API. 
2. Each "compute_fractal" worker thread creates a part of the mandelbrot fractal.
3. After completing of the computation, a worker thread locks a mutex (Mx) and writes to the image buffer. 
4. The master thread (thread 0) then displays the contents of the image buffer and releases the mutex.

Running Example:
1) make

Result:
The simulation will take a bit of time to perform the required calculations before any output is displayed, followed by a printout of the mandelbrot fractal.
