Calculates correlation  between x[] and y[]

\param x pointer to input buffer #1
\param y pointer to input buffer #2
\param length length of input samples
\param nc number of correlation outputs
\param Qshift shift factor after accumulation
\param cor pointer to output correlation buffer(S16)

\details

\b Assembly \b Assumptions
 - \a length is a multiple of 4 and no less than 4
 - \a x is aligned by 4
 - \a y is aligned by 8
 - \a cor is aligned by 8

\b Cycle-Count
 - [2*(length/4)-ceil(nc/4)+1]*ceil(nc/4)*3/2 + 7*ceil(nc/4) + 15

\b Notes
 - 64-bit accumulator used for summation.
