- General
- Known issues
- Changes
- Notices

#### General ####

Special Note: This release includes an alternative set of libraries
located under "no-dealloc_return-libs".  To use them, one must explicitly link
to them -- they are not automatically picked up by the linker.


Please send all support questions and bug reports to
llvm-hexagon-support@qualcomm.com

This release is based on the LLVM.org Community Release 3.2, enhanced
with optimizations from the Qualcomm LLVM team.  As a cross compiler,
it runs on x86-64 Linux or Windows host and generates code for Hexagon
targets.
